# PRD: Workflow Execution Tracing & Monitoring

## Overview
Add an "Executions" button to the workflow designer that opens a side panel showing historical workflow executions. Users can trace execution paths visually on the workflow diagram and inspect input/output data for each node.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users have no visibility into workflow execution history or debugging capabilities when workflows fail. They cannot:
- See which executions ran for a workflow
- Understand where executions failed
- Inspect data flow between nodes
- Debug workflow issues efficiently

## Success Metrics
- Reduce workflow debugging time by 70%
- Increase user engagement with workflow monitoring by 50%
- Decrease support tickets related to workflow failures by 40%

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Workflow Developers & Operations Teams

**As a workflow developer, I want to:**
- View all executions for my workflow so I can monitor its performance
- See execution status and duration to identify performance issues
- Trace execution paths visually to understand workflow behavior
- Inspect input/output data at each node to debug data transformation issues

**As an operations team member, I want to:**
- Quickly identify failed workflows and their failure points
- Monitor workflow execution patterns over time
- Access detailed execution logs for troubleshooting

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Executions Button
- **Location**: Workflow designer toolbar, next to Save and Reset buttons
- **Label**: "Executions"
- **Icon**: History/clock icon
- **Behavior**: Opens execution side panel

### 2. Execution Side Panel
- **Position**: Right side of the screen
- **Width**: 400px (resizable)
- **State**: Collapsible/expandable
- **Content**: Execution list table

#### 2.1 Execution List Table
**Columns:**
1. **Execution ID**: First 8 characters of UUID, clickable
2. **Status**: Badge with color coding
   - Success: Green
   - Failed: Red  
   - Running: Blue
   - Queued: Yellow
3. **Started At**: Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
4. **Duration**: Human readable (e.g., "1.2s", "45ms", "2m 30s")

**Features:**
- Sortable by all columns (default: Started At DESC)
- Pagination (20 items per page)
- Search/filter by status
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for active executions

### 3. Execution Path Tracing
**Trigger**: Click on execution row in the side panel

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Completed nodes**: Green border and background tint
- **Failed nodes**: Red border and background tint  
- **Skipped nodes**: Gray border and background tint
- **Current/active node**: Pulsing blue border (for running executions)
- **Execution path**: Highlighted edges with directional arrows

**Animation**: 
- Smooth transition showing execution flow
- 500ms delay between node highlights
- Option to replay animation

### 4. Node Input/Output Inspection
**Trigger**: Click on any traced node during execution view

**Left Panel (Input Data):**
- JSON viewer with syntax highlighting
- Collapsible/expandable sections
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Search within JSON

**Right Panel (Output Data):**
- JSON viewer with syntax highlighting  
- Error messages for failed nodes
- Execution timing information
- Node-specific metrics

**Panel Behavior:**
- Slides in from left/right sides
- Overlays workflow designer
- Close button and ESC key to dismiss
- Resizable width

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
1. **ExecutionsButton**: Toolbar button component
2. **ExecutionSidePanel**: Collapsible side panel
3. **ExecutionTable**: Data table with sorting/filtering
4. **ExecutionTracer**: Visual path highlighting system
5. **NodeInspector**: Input/output data viewer panels

### API Endpoints
```
GET /executions?limit=50,workflow_id={id},status={status}
- Retirns list of executions

GET /executions/{id}/steps
- Returns: Detailed execution trace with node states and data
- Returns: Input/output data for specific node in execution


```

## UI/UX Design Specifications

### Design System
- Follow existing SwissPipe design patterns
- Use consistent color scheme for status indicators
- Maintain responsive design principles

### Color Palette
- Success: #10B981 (green)
- Error: #EF4444 (red)
- Warning: #F59E0B (amber)
- Info: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Neutral: #6B7280 (gray)

### Typography
- Execution ID: Monospace font
- Timestamps: Regular weight, smaller size
- Status badges: Semi-bold, uppercase

### Responsive Behavior
- Side panel collapses on mobile devices
- Table switches to card layout on small screens
- Node inspection panels stack vertically on mobile

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Database schema updates
- Basic API endpoints
- Execution side panel component
- Basic execution list table

### Phase 2: Visual Tracing (Week 3-4)
- Execution path highlighting system
- Node state visualization
- Animation framework
- Click handlers for node selection

### Phase 3: Data Inspection (Week 5-6)
- Node input/output panels
- JSON viewers with syntax highlighting
- Search and navigation features
- Copy/export functionality

### Phase 4: Polish & Performance (Week 7-8)
- Auto-refresh and real-time updates
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling improvements
- User testing and bug fixes

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Execution list loads within 500ms
- Visual tracing animates at 60fps
- JSON viewers handle up to 10MB data files
- Auto-refresh does not impact UI responsiveness

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

### Browser Support
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Large JSON payloads**: May cause browser performance issues
  - *Mitigation*: Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading

### Medium Risk  
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket connection management complexity (Do not implelemnt right now)
  - *Mitigation*: Graceful fallback to polling, connection retry logic

### Low Risk
- **Database performance**: Complex queries on execution history
  - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing, query optimization, caching

## Success Criteria
- Feature launches without performance degradation
- 90% of users can successfully trace executions within first use
- No increase in page load times
- Positive user feedback scores (4.5+/5)
