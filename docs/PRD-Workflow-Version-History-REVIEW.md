# PRD Review: Workflow Version History Feature

## Review Date
October 24, 2025

## Overall Assessment
**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED with corrections applied**

The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for implementation. Several critical inconsistencies were identified and corrected during review.

---

## Issues Found & Corrected

### ✅ FIXED - Critical Issue #1: API Response Schema Mismatch
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** Fixed

**Problem:**
The "Get Specific Version Details" endpoint showed `workflow_name`, `workflow_description`, `nodes`, `edges` as separate root-level fields, which didn't match the database schema storing everything in `workflow_snapshot`.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated API response to return `workflow_snapshot` as a nested object containing the complete workflow JSON, matching the database schema and ensuring consistency with import/export formats.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "...",
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "workflow_snapshot": {
    "name": "...",
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
  }
}
```

### ✅ FIXED - Moderate Issue #2: Missing workflow_id in List Response
**Severity:** Moderate
**Status:** Fixed

**Problem:**
The "Get Version History" response didn't include `workflow_id`, which could be needed for subsequent API calls.

**Fix Applied:**
Added `workflow_id` to each version entry in the list response.

---

### ✅ DOCUMENTED - Moderate Issue #3: workflow_name Extraction
**Severity:** Moderate
**Status:** Documented

**Problem:**
The `workflow_name` field in the list response needs to be extracted from the JSON `workflow_snapshot` column, which wasn't documented.

**Fix Applied:**
Added implementation note explaining that `workflow_name` is extracted from `workflow_snapshot` JSON during query for display purposes, and full snapshot is not returned in list view for performance.

---

## Remaining Considerations

### ⚠️ Open Question: Initial Version Creation
**Status:** Not Resolved

The PRD recommends automatically creating v1 when a workflow is first created (line 428-429), but this isn't reflected in:
- Business Logic section
- User Flow section
- API endpoint specifications

**Recommendation:** Clarify in next revision whether:
- Initial workflow creation should auto-generate v1 with message "Initial workflow creation"
- OR version history only starts after the first explicit save

---

## Schema & API Consistency Check

### ✅ Database Schema
- Single `workflow_snapshot` TEXT column storing complete JSON
- Proper indices on `workflow_id` and `created_at`
- Unique constraint on `(workflow_id, version_number)`
- CASCADE delete when workflow is deleted

### ✅ API Endpoints
- POST /api/v1/workflows/:workflow_id/versions - Create version
- GET /api/v1/workflows/:workflow_id/versions - Get history list
- GET /api/v1/workflows/:workflow_id/versions/:version_id - Get version details

All endpoints now consistent with database schema.

### ✅ Frontend Components
- CommitMessageModal.vue - For commit message input
- VersionHistoryPanel.vue - For viewing history
- History button in WorkflowDesignerHeader.vue

All components properly specified with props, emits, and UX flows.

---

## JSON Format Consistency Verification

### ✅ Verified: Same JSON Format Across Features
The PRD correctly specifies that `workflow_snapshot` uses the **exact same JSON format** as:
- JSON View in workflow designer
- Exported workflow files
- Imported workflow files

**Format:**
```json
{
  "name": "Workflow Name",
  "description": "Description",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node-id",
      "name": "Node Name",
      "node_type": { ... },
      "position_x": 100,
      "position_y": 100
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from_node_id": "source",
      "to_node_id": "target",
      "condition_result": null,
      "source_handle_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures:
- Version snapshots can be directly imported as workflows
- JSON View can display version snapshots correctly
- Export/import functionality works seamlessly with versions

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - All aspects covered (DB, API, Frontend, UX, Security)
2. **Clear User Stories** - Well-defined acceptance criteria
3. **Performance Considerations** - Pagination, indexing, storage estimates
4. **Security & Privacy** - Authentication, authorization, data retention policies
5. **Future Enhancements** - Clear roadmap for V2 features
6. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E, and load tests defined

---

## Minor Suggestions (Optional)

### 1. Add Workflow Edit Detection
Consider adding logic to detect if workflow has actually changed before requiring commit message. This prevents unnecessary versions for accidental "Save" clicks.

**Implementation:**
- Compare current workflow JSON with last saved version
- If identical, skip commit message modal
- Show "No changes to save" notification

### 2. Commit Message Templates
Consider providing common templates/suggestions:
- "Fix: [description]"
- "Feature: [description]"
- "Refactor: [description]"
- "Update: [description]"

### 3. Version Numbering Clarification
Consider adding to docs:
- Version numbers are per-workflow (not global)
- Version numbers are sequential and immutable
- Deleted versions leave gaps in numbering
